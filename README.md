# ðŸ€¨Mahjong Solitaire Game

This project we made for the algorithm and programming exam was inspired by the Mahjong Solitaire game that we remember from Windows 7.

The tiles of the game were drawn by us using Adobe Photoshop and added to the game using the Raylib graphics library. Although the algorithm of this game, which we wrote in C language, challenged us, it provided us with a lot of permanent knowledge from pointers to file management.

## ðŸ€™Game Information
â€¢ Players have to match two same tiles on table, hence these tiles will be removed from the table. 

â€¢ The tile player chose to remove from the table:</br>
mustn't have any other tiles on it,</br>
at least one side (right or left) must be empty,

â€¢ There are 36 different tiles with 4 copies each. So players will have 144 total tiles from the beginning of the game. Map's difficulty doesn't change the number of tiles.

â€¢ Players have to remove all the tiles from the table within the given time. 

â€¢ Shuffle: Shuffles the current tiles on table.</br>â€¢ Hint: Gives a hint for matchable 2 tiles.</br>â€¢ Undo: Removes the last changes.

â€¢ Game has a scoreboard file that stores the top 10 scores - player names and displays it in a descending order.
